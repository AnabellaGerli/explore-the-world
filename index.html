<section class="mountains">
    <h4 id="mountains"> Let's go to the mountains</h4>
    <p>Spending actively a few days in the mountains will get your body in perfect shape and your mood will naturally improve – there’s scientifically based fact that outdoors physical exercise produces loads of endorphins (“happy hormones”).</p>

 <section class="beach">
    <h4 id="beach"> Let's go to the beach </h4>
    <p>The expansive view of the ocean water, often referred to as “blue space” by psychologists, actually calms our mind. If you've ever sat staring at an ocean and found that your problems seem to melt away as a sense of peace overcomes you, you're not alone. We are biologically hardwired to experience the beach</p>

<section class="city">
    <h4 id="city"> Let's go to the city </h4>
    <p> We love the city. We love watching people, we love the buzz that moves through buildings, parks and squares like an airflow. The city is home to multiple conformities. In a city it all happens; a microcosmos of opportunities and historic failures. </p>
